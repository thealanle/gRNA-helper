# gRNA-helper

- gRNA-helper.py: A primary script for this repository. Will contain functionality for finding and evaluating potential sequences for knocking out a target gene in a given genome.
- mecA_fasta.txt: Contains FASTA data for a single gene, mecA. This will be our target gene during development.
- mrsa_fasta.txt: The genome for a strain of MRSA. Contains multiple gene entries in FASTA format.
- mrsa_fasta_mini.txt: A truncated version of the above to reduce runtime during development.
